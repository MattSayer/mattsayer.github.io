I began with the general concept of piloting a small submarine trapped in a vicious storm, expanding it out to a simple adventure-game structure where the player must collect various items to Macgyver together a solution to the storm problem.\n\nAfter fleshing out the general game structure, I created a relationship diagram to model the various systems I would need to build and how they would interact with each other. While not 100% accurate to the final product, this initial design is quite close and ensured the implementation phase progressed smoothly and efficiently.',

          'To maintain performance, the WaveManager processes requests on-demand and only calculates displacement within a small sample radius of an object\'s world-space position, using a grid-based lookup to reduce performance costs further. These results are cached per-frame to avoid repeated calculations for bodies in close proximity to one another.',

Subscribers to that GameEvent are then notified, allowing them to respond accordingly without a direct dependency on the calling class.',

          'To minimise the number of audio sources in the scene and streamline audio management, I implemented an audio controller to handle audio requests. The controller maintains separate pools of audio sources for one-off audio requests of various purposes (UI/2D audio, 3D spatial audio) as well as a pool for loaned "proxy" audio sources for classes that produce looping or frequent audio requests.',
          'When audio requests are made, the controller gets the next available audio source from the corresponding pool and configures it according to the request parameters as well as the current game state, adjusting volume, mixer groups, and location (for 3D audio) before playing the requested audio clip.',
          'This approach ensures consistency between audio-emitting classes, and simplifies the process of adding audio to additional classes. It also allows for features such as automatic cross-fading between music tracks (for instance, when pausing the game) as well as easy updating of volume levels when the player changes audio settings.',
          'As mentioned above, the audio controller also provides a ProxyAudioSource object for classes that require continuous or frequent audio emission, such as the engine of the submarine. The ProxyAudioSource acts as a wrapper for a native AudioSource component, managing volume, cross-fading, and other audio properties to once again ensure consistency with the rest of the audio in the game. This proxy approach also provides automatic reclamation of the audio source if the owning class is destroyed or otherwise removed from the scene.'

My two teammates handled the audio and visual assets for the game, while I took care of the programming as well as implementing everything in Godot (level design, animation, UI, etcâ€¦).\n\nDespite the challenges of working with an unfamiliar engine, I believe we accomplished quite a lot with our project. I put together a pseudo shader-compilation process to ameliorate some of Godot\'s inherent shader stuttering issues. I\'m also quite happy with the screen-capture component I built to highlight the before and after states of the game\'s timed decoration segments.',
